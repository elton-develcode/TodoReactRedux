</br></br>

> Leroy Merlin Brazil  ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· - Instala Team

</br>

**Why:** By the need to manage installers to provide services.

**What:** Some purchase orders can generate orders from various service.
</br></br></br>

## Summary
</br>

The **Lm-Instala-Provider** is a module for managing service provider and craftsman to perform customer service orders.

</br>

## Concepts

</br>

Let's say you know how to provide a specific service, such as installing air conditioners, and you want to provide this service to Leroy Merlin (good idea yah :muscle: ).

You will need to register your business by providing some details and associating service providers with you.

Soon after your registration is validated, you will be available to execute work orders according to your specificity.

</br></br>

## Getting started

### Getting it

* **Software**
  * [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/overview/index.html) - Java Development Kit 8+
  * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency management 3.3+
  * [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database 8+
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) - Infrastructure settings 17.06.0+
  * [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) - Container orchestrator 1.6.0+

* **Hardware**
  * Core i3 processor or better
  * 2Gb Ram (recommended min 4GB)
  * Internet Access (required for Github Login)

 </br></br>

### Installing It

1. :octocat: Clone this repository and go to the lm-instala-provider folder:
 

```
git clone https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/lm-instala-provider.git

cd lm-instala-provider
```

</br></br>

### Configuring It

 Settings for docker-compose.yml

 ##### JWT

   JSON Web Token (JWT) is an industry-standard RCT 7519 method for performing two-party authentication through a signed token that   authenticates a web request. This token is a Base64 code that stores JSON objects with data that allows request authentication.
 ```
  JWT_SECRET = {jwt_secret}
 ```

 ##### DB_URL

  Is the required JDBC String to connect to mysql database with java or the mysql workbench tool too.
 ```
  DB_URL = jdbc:mysql://{ip}:{port}/{db_schema}
 ```

 ##### DB_USER

  Parameter required for database access authorization.
  ```
   DB_USER = {username}
  ```

 ##### DB_PASSWORD

 Parameter required for database access authorization.
 ```
  DB_PASSWORD = {password}
 ```

 ##### MAIL_HOST

 Parameter required for authorization to access the deploy platform.
 ```
  MAIL_HOST = {mail_host}
 ```

 ##### MAIL_PORT

 Parameter required for authorization to access the deploy platform.
 ```
  MAIL_PORT = {mail_port}
 ```

 ##### MAIL_USER

 Parameter required for authorization to access the deploy platform.
 ```
  MAIL_USER = {mail_user}
 ```

 ##### MAIL_PASSWORD

 Parameter required for authorization to access the deploy platform.
 ```
  MAIL_PASSWORD = {mail_password}
 ```
 :bangbang: Where {ip}, {port}, {db_schema}, {username}, {password}, {mail_host}, {mail_port}, {mail_user} and
{mail_password} must be replaced with actual database and mail values.

 Example for docker-compose.yml:
</br>
```
 version: '3.1'
 services:
   web:
     build:
       context: .
       dockerfile: Dockerfile
       args:
         PARAM: argument
     container_name: name_for_container_docker
     ports:
       - 8089:8080
     environment:
       DB_URL: jdbc:mysql://db_url:3306/database
       DB_USER: user
       DB_PASSWORD: password
       JWT_SECRET: token
       MAIL_HOST: email@email.com
       MAIL_PORT: 123
       MAIL_USER: User
       MAIL_PASSWORD: password
       API_INSTALA: http://localhost:8086/lm-instala-api
       API_INSTALA_PDP: http://localhost:8087/lm-instala-provider
       API_INSTALA_AUTH: http://localhost:8086/lm-instala-api
       API_INSTALA_PARAM: http://localhost:8089/lm-instala-parameters
       API_INSTALA_I18N: http://localhost:8086/lm-instala-api
       API_INSTALA_SATSFTN: http://localhost:8086/lm-instala-rating
       API_KEY: key
```
 :warning:  Important file identification

</br></br>

### Running it

1. On terminal type
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

2. Use docker-compose to start :

```
docker-compose up --build
```
> Check in the docker-compose.yml file what port will be exposed on your host and ensure that they are not already used.

When all components are started, you can access the app at :
* **http://localhost:8087**

## Testing

To run the tests, run the command :pray:

```
mvn test
```
Maven himself is in charge of running the tests and returning the results.
